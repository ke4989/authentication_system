Implement a **simple** identity authentication system based on time-based one-time password (TOTP):

1. A web login system based on the python flask framework to implement the backend;

2. Multi-factor identity authentication using TOTP and user password;

3. Key exchange based on ECDH and transmission data encryption.

Start:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./code/main.py
```

Web html needs to be deployed by yourself (such as using the Live Server plugin of VS Code)
